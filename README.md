ABOUT ME

Keep smiling, because life is a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.

The collection of post at the website / blog contains descriptions of some of the equipment I use for HAM Amateur Radio.  I do things with purpose, conviction, mindfulness, and confidence in my life, all from my innate sense of pride with proven moral and ethical values.  A simple guy first that is egoless.
